~      We're always looking for people to talk. It'll be informal and low
~      pressure. The themes we have in mind are
~
~           - Plugin of the month -- you've got that plugin you love that
~             everyone should use. Show us!
~           - Built-in feature of the month -- show us something Vim does
~             right out of the box that we might not know about. Some
~             ideas: netrw, buffers / windows / tabs, registers, macros,
~             :help, tags... the list goes on.
~           - My vimrc -- a short tour of your setup and how it helps you
~             day-to-day -- simple or complex, we want to see it
~           - :help -- you're doing something, but you know there has to
~             be a better way. Tell us about it and we'll try to help.
~           - Others -- if you have something else you think would be a
~             good fit, let us know!
~ 
~      If you're interested in speaking, email <a href="mailto:hi@vimtl.ca?subject=Speaking%20at%20Vimtl">hi@vimtl.ca</a>. If you
~      want to speak but you need ideas, I have some!
~
